I bring a unique blend of academic insights and practical experience to any Scala or functional programming role. During my time in academia, I've specialised in software verification and advanced functional programming. During my time in industry, I've leveraged foundational functional programming principles to drive product development and simplify complex systems.

# Professional Experience

<dl>
  <dt>Scala Engineer</dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="venue">ITV PLC, April 2022 - present</p>
    <p><u>Product</u>
    ITV News serves an average of over 1 million daily page views.
    Purely functional backend Scala stack using cats, cats-effect and fs2.
    Daily use of Kafka, PostgreSQL and Redis. 
    Delivery through GA and Jenkins. 
    Deployment through AWS, Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform. RESTful and GraphQL APIs. 
    Significant emphasis on testing, including integration tests and property-based tests. 
    Product development following agile processes.
    </p>

    <p><u>Role</u>
    Actively led discussions around architectural solutions.
    Brought forward initiatives that generalise existing ad-hoc solutions into more powerful principled ones.
    Created tasks aiming to strengthen backend product development.
    Re-engineered systems and codebases to simplify structure.
    Directly coordinated with stakeholders and responded to external bug reports.
    Assisted colleagues with functional programming queries, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Types and Type Changing Operations for Distributed Data Structures</dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="venue">Microsoft Research Cambridge, 2021</p>
    <p><u>Product</u>
    Research on supporting <it>type changing operations</it> for <it>distributed data structures</it>.
    Akin to a real-time collaborative text editor, but where the data is structured and typed instead of plain text.
    The operations executed on the data need to be well typed and enable type changes.
    </p>

    <p><u>Role</u>
    Placement in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/calc-intelligence/">Calc Intelligence</a> group, took part in their day-to-day activities.
    Modelled a distributed system with type changing operations, defined some of its desirable properties and mechanised proofs that show they hold.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>RISE: a functional pattern-based data-parallel language</dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="venue">Edinburgh University, 2021</p>
    <p><u>Product</u>
    <a href="rise-lang.org">RISE</a> a functional pattern-based data-parallel language.
    A high-level functional Scala DSL gets compiled to high performance C, OpenMP, OpenCL and CUDA.
    The program is rewritten following user-defined optimisation strategies.
    </p>

    <p><u>Role</u>
    Led refactoring efforts to consolidate the existing codebase and addressed longstanding issues.
    Interfaced with researchers actively developing new features.
    </p>
  </dd>

# Academic Qualifications

<dl>
  <dt>PhD Computing Science, unfinished</dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="venue">University of Glasgow, 2019 - April 2022</p>
    <p><u>Machine verification of typed process calculi.</u></p>
    <p>
      Modelled typed process calculi with support for linear types, defined type safety properties, and proved they hold.
      Used theorem provers, dependent types and advanced functional programming techniques to mechanise the models and proofs, and verify them correct.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dd>
    <p class="venue">University of Glasgow, 2018 - 2019</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>BSc Hons Computer Science, <b>First class honours</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="venue">University of Strathclyde, 2014 - 2018</p>
    <p>Awarded Andrew McGettrick prize for <u>outstanding performance</u> throughout the degree (2 recipients).
