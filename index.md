I am a Scala engineer doing functional programming for ITV Shows & News.

I was a PhD student at the [Formal Methods Research Group][FMRG] at the University of Glasgow.

My CV is [here](/static/cv.pdf).
Sometimes I [tweet][twitter].

# Research Interests

I am interested in compilers, programming language theory, process calculi, type theory, and machine verification.
During my PhD I am working on the **machine verification of typed process calculi**.
